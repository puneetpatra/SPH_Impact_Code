# SPH_Impact_Code
# The main file for running the code is impact_sph.c
# It reads the input data from balldata.in and prints energy output in the file energy.output.
# The trajectory is also printed in the trajectory.lammpstrj file, which can be visualized in Ovito
# Different corrections in SPH can be turned on or off depending on the value 1 or 0 at the beginning of the code.
